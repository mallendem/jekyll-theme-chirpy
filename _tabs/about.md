I'm a Site Reliability Engineer with 6+ years of DevOps experience and extensive infrastructure expertise. I'm passionate about system reliability, scalability, and emerging technologies that drive modern infrastructure.

In this blog, I'll share insights on SRE practices, infrastructure automation, monitoring strategies, and lessons learned from the trenches. I occasionally venture into topics outside my wheelhouse, so feel free to reach out via email if you spot something that needs correction.

All opinions expressed here are my own and don't reflect the views of my employer.
